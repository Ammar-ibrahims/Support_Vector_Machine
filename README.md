Machine Learning Algorithms: Support Vector Machine
This repository contains an implementation of the Support Vector Machine algorithm as part of my machine learning studies. It includes Support Vector Machine model, along with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project serves as a foundational step in understanding and applying supervised learning techniques.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
